abstract: Automated segmentation of brain structures (objects) in MR three‐dimensional (3D) images for quantitative analysis has been a challenge and probabilistic atlases (PAs) are among the most well‐succeeded approaches. However, the existing models do not adapt to possible object anomalies due to the presence of a disease or a surgical procedure. Post‐processing operation does not solve the problem, for example, tissue classification to detect and remove such anomalies inside the resulting segmentation mask, because segmentation errors on healthy tissues cannot be fixed. Such anomalies very often alter the shape and texture of the brain structures, making them different from the appearance of the model. In this paper, we present an effective and efficient adaptive probabilistic atlas, named AdaPro, to circumvent the problem and evaluate it on a challenging task — the segmentation of the left hemisphere, right hemisphere, and cerebellum, without pons and medulla, in 3D MR‐T1 brain images of Epilepsy patients. This task is challenging due to temporal lobe resections, artifacts, and the absence of contrast in some parts between the structures of interest.
