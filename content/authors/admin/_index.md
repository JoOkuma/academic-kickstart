I'm currently in my first year of MSc in Computer Science at the University of Campinas, Brazil. I've been researching at [LIDS](https://lids.ic.unicamp.br/) since 2017 under the supervision of [Prof. Alexandre Falcão](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HTFEUaUAAAAJ). In 2019-2020 I was fortunate enough to do a winter research internship at [LIGM](http://ligm.u-pem.fr/) under the supervision of [Prof. Laurent Najman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j-2_cT0AAAAJ).

Feel free to reach me at [jordao.bragantini@gmail.com](mailto:jordao.bragantini@gmail.com).
